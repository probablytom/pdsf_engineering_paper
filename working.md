# Introduction

# Concepts

## Inner and Outer Aspects
<!--
Calling them inner and outer instead of micro and macro because lisp macros are both something we use and already too well established to use the name here. It would get confusing given macros are what we implement, and a micro-macro is a macro, but a macro-macro isn't!
